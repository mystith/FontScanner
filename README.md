# FontScanner

This program was designed for scanning bitmap text (non anti-aliased) and producing images of each character.
Intended to be used with another program, Goldies-OCR, for scanning an image for characters of a bitmap font.
Each character scanned must be manually labeled (a scan of the letter 'A' must be labelled manually as an 'A'.
